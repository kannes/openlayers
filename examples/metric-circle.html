title: Metric Circle
shortdesc: Example of a circular polygon with a radius specified in meters
docs: >
  A circular geometry created via `ol/geom/Circle`'s `Circle` constructor will use
  the unit of the given coordinate reference system for the radius. For the default
  Pseudo Mercator system these are "fake" meters much different from actual real-world
  meters pretty much everywhere on the planet. A circle with a radius of 1500 of
  these "fake" meters is shown in red.
  
  To create a circle more true to actual geodesic measurements, `ol/geom/Polygon`
  provides the `circular` method to create a circle approximation in WGS84 coordinates.
  A circle with a radius of 1500 actual meters is shown in blue.
