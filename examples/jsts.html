  Example showing the integration of <a href="https://github.com/bjornharrtell/jsts">JSTS</a>
  with OpenLayers.

  As JSTS operates in cartesian coordinate space, special attention has to be taken when
  performing geometric calculations. In this example the local factor between meters and
  map units is used to make sure the buffer radius is calculated correctly.
